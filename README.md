# Junglebook
A simple Flask application where you can be a monkey and share your bananas with other monkeys.

Live demo with fake (but awesome!) monkeys: [Junglebook - Demo](http://the-junglebook.herokuapp.com/).
The page is responsive and should work just fine with a mobile device.

Junglebook has the following functionalities:
- create an account (register)
  - monkeys name and email needs to be unique
- login / logout
- view other monkeys profile and edit / remove your own profile
  - pick avatar picture from four different cute monkey pictures
- share / unshare bananas with other monkeys (one way sharing - like twitter follow)
  - you can find monkeys from the 'jungle' page
  - has pagination
- make best friend (also one way)
